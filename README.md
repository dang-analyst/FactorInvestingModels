ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the effectiveness of factor investing models in the cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrencies are often regarded as relatively new form of financial assets.  Hence, it is important for investors to understand how the cryptocurrency market operates to maximize expected returns. 
The dataset used in this study is comprised of 20 selected cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization from 31st July 2017 to 1st Jan 2021. This study employs the use of capital asset pricing model, Fama-French 3 Factor Model, Carhart 4 Factor Model. We then analyze the models using alphas, betas, mean-squared-error, and R-Squared values and derive our findings. Even though results show that these models have limited capability in predicting returns in the market, we are able to explain the positive and negative correlation between cryptocurrencies, excess market return, size premium, value premium, and momentum factors.
Keywords: cryptocurrency, CAPM, Fama-French 3 Factor Model, Carhart 4 Factor Model, SMB, HML, MOM, factor investing models.
